# ☁️ SmartCloud Multi-Agent System

A professional Multi-Agent System built with **LangGraph**, **Groq (Llama 3.3)**, and **Streamlit**.

## 🚀 Features
- **AI Supervisor:** Intelligent routing of user requests.
- **Hardware Monitoring:** Real-time CPU and RAM tracking using `psutil`.
- **Task Automation:** Automated Python code generation and file saving.
- **Persistent Memory:** SQLite-based conversation history.

## 🛠️ Setup
1. Clone the repo: `git clone <your-repo-link>`
2. Install libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Add your Groq API Key in `agent_brain.py`.
4. Run the web app: `streamlit run web_app.py`


## 🎯 Project Objectives (The Aim)
1. **Intelligent Automation:** Implement a Supervisor-Worker architecture to automate cloud-based task routing.
2. **Hardware-AI Synergy:** Create a bridge between Python system metrics and LLM decision-making.
3. **User-Centric Design:** Deliver a high-performance web dashboard (Streamlit) that simplifies cloud monitoring for end-users.
4. **Reliability:** Ensure 100% data persistence using SQL-based checkpointers for long-term agent memory.
